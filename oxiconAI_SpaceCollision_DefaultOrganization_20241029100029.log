According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "A game where randomly sized spancecrft are flying around the screen, that always start on the outside edge, and continuously spawn. The user moving the character with their mouse, has to avoid touching any of the random circles which will be space junk flying around the screen. add timer to check how long a user can survive".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: A game where randomly sized spancecrft are flying around the screen, that always start on the outside edge, and continuously spawn. The user moving the character with their mouse, has to avoid touching any of the random circles which will be space junk flying around the screen. add timer to check how long a user can survive.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This is the main file that runs the game. It imports the necessary modules, sets up the screen, defines the Player and SpaceJunk classes, creates the player object, and handles the game loop. It also checks for collisions between the player and space junk, and updates the screen accordingly. The game loop continues until the player collides with space junk or the user closes the window.

Next, we will create the Player and SpaceJunk classes.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code looks well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `SpaceJunk` class, the movement of the space junk towards the center of the screen is not smooth. The current implementation moves the space junk towards the center in discrete steps, which can result in jerky movement. To ensure smooth movement, we can use vector normalization to calculate the direction and magnitude of the movement.

Here's how you can revise the code:

1. In the `SpaceJunk` class, add a new method called `move_towards_center`:

```python
def move_towards_center(self):
    dx = screen_width // 2 - self.rect.centerx
    dy = screen_height // 2 - self.rect.centery
    distance = max(abs(dx), abs(dy))
    if distance > 0:
        speed = 2
        direction = pygame.Vector2(dx / distance, dy / distance)
        self.rect.center += direction * speed
```

2. In the `update` method of the `SpaceJunk` class, replace the movement code with a call to the `move_towards_center` method:

```python
def update(self):
    self.move_towards_center()
```

By using vector normalization, the space junk will smoothly move towards the center of the screen.

Please make the above revisions to ensure smooth movement of the space junk towards the center of the screen. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code looks well-structured and follows most of the regulations. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `SpaceJunk` class, the movement of the space junk towards the center of the screen is not smooth. The current implementation moves the space junk towards the center in discrete steps, which can result in jerky movement. To ensure smooth movement, we can use vector normalization to calculate the direction and magnitude of the movement.

Here's how you can revise the code:

1. In the `SpaceJunk` class, add a new method called `move_towards_center`:

```python
def move_towards_center(self):
    dx = screen_width // 2 - self.rect.centerx
    dy = screen_height // 2 - self.rect.centery
    distance = max(abs(dx), abs(dy))
    if distance > 0:
        speed = 2
        direction = pygame.Vector2(dx / distance, dy / distance)
        self.rect.center += direction * speed
```

2. In the `update` method of the `SpaceJunk` class, replace the movement code with a call to the `move_towards_center` method:

```python
def update(self):
    self.move_towards_center()
```

By using vector normalization, the space junk will smoothly move towards the center of the screen.

Please make the above revisions to ensure smooth movement of the space junk towards the center of the screen. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: A game where randomly sized spancecrft are flying around the screen, that always start on the outside edge, and continuously spawn. The user moving the character with their mouse, has to avoid touching any of the random circles which will be space junk flying around the screen. add timer to check how long a user can survive.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

In the update method of the SpaceJunk class, replace the movement code with a call to the move_towards_center method:\n\npython\ndef update(self):\n    self.move_towards_center()\n\n\nBy using vector normalization, the space junk will smoothly move towards the center of the screen.\n\nPlease make the above revisions to ensure smooth movement of the space junk towards the center of the screen.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules, such as `pygame`. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the code:

```python
import pygame
import random
import sys
```

Also, make sure that the required modules are installed in the environment where the code will be executed."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: A game where randomly sized spancecrft are flying around the screen, that always start on the outside edge, and continuously spawn. The user moving the character with their mouse, has to avoid touching any of the random circles which will be space junk flying around the screen. add timer to check how long a user can survive.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the code needs to import the `pygame` module in order to use its functions and classes.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statement at the beginning of the code:
```python
import pygame
```

Also, make sure that the `pygame` module is installed in the environment where the code will be executed. You can install it using the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```

Once the import statement is added and the module is installed, the code should be able to use the `pygame` functions and classes correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the code needs to import the `pygame` module in order to use its functions and classes.

<SUGGESTION>
Add the following import statement at the beginning of the code:
```python
import pygame
```

Also, make sure that the `pygame` module is installed in the environment where the code will be executed. You can install it using the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```

Once the import statement is added and the module is installed, the code should be able to use the `pygame` functions and classes correctly."

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: A game where randomly sized spancecrft are flying around the screen, that always start on the outside edge, and continuously spawn. The user moving the character with their mouse, has to avoid touching any of the random circles which will be space junk flying around the screen. add timer to check how long a user can survive.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]
